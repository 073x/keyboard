    Invokes a callback every time a hotkey is pressed. The hotkey must
    be in the format `ctrl+shift+a, s`. This would trigger when the user holds
    ctrl, shift and "a" at once, releases, and then presses "s". To represent
    literal commas, pluses, and spaces, use their names ('comma', 'plus',
    'space').

    - `args` is an optional list of arguments to passed to the callback during
    each invocation.
    - `suppress` defines if successful triggers should block the keys from being
    sent to other programs.
    - `timeout` is the amount of seconds allowed to pass between key presses.
    - `trigger_on_release` if true, the callback is invoked on key release instead
    of key press.

    Returns a Hook object with `.enable()` and `.disable()` methods.

    Note: hotkeys are activated when the last key is *pressed*, not released.
    Note: the callback is executed in a separate thread, asynchronously. For an
    example of how to use a callback synchronously, see `wait`.
